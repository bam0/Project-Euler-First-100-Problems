# Project-Euler-First-100-Problems
The first 100 Project Euler problems using Python

**Through** this series of [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net) problems, I will be utilizing different techniques from python and mathematics to 
provide insight into how to solve some interesting programming challenges. For most problems, there is no 'best'
approach. However, there are certainly better and worse ways to go about tackling them. 

**I hope** to provide insight to anyone else interested in math or programming by showing my thought process and the
tools I've developed after working with python for over a year. Please feel free to offer feedback and I will be happy
to fix my code or add some new information.

**As well** as this repository, I will also be creating a blog called "Alex's Python Problem-a-Day" where I discuss 
problems I have been working on or am interested in.

**Let's** all make the world of python devlopment a fun and engaging place!
